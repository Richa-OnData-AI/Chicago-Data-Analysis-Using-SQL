# Chicago-Data-Analysis-Using-SQL
This project involves analyzing real-world datasets from the City of Chicago using SQL. The datasets include census data, crime records, and public school information. The goal is to answer practical analytical questions related to socio-economic conditions, crime patterns, and school safety across Chicago community areas.

## Objective:
This project uses real-world Chicago census, crime, and public school datasets to perform practical data analysis using SQL.

**Key goals include:**
1.Practicing core SQL concepts such as:
  - Filtering, aggregation, grouping, ordering, and subqueries

2.Analyzing data from multiple related tables:
  - Chicago census data
  - Chicago crime records
  - Chicago public school data

3.Deriving meaningful insights such as:
  - Identifying crime-prone community areas
  - Analyzing poverty levels and hardship index
  - Evaluating school safety trends by school type
